    'I can\'t think of any sorrow in the world that a hot bath wouldn\'t help, just a little bit.',
    'I cannot believe that the inscrutable universe turns on an axis of suffering; surely the strange beauty of the world must somewhere rest on pure joy!',
    'I cannot live without books.',
    'I cannot pretend to feel impartial about colours. I rejoice with the brilliant ones and am genuinely sorry for the poor browns.',
    'I cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman\'s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of.',
    'I can\'t talk about our love story, so I will talk about math. I am not a mathematician, but I know this: There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There\'s .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I\'m likely to get. But, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn\'t trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I\'m grateful.',

    'I catnap now and then, but I think while I nap, so it\'s not a waste of time.',
    'I could not conceive that fans actually wanted me to sign something. It took a long time for me to figure out (a) just say \'Thank you\' and sign the thing, and (b) smile in the picture, because if you try to just half-smile you\'re going to look constipated.',
    'I couldn\'t kill myself, couldn\'t let go like so many others had. I wonder if in their last moments they\'d changed their minds, but there was no boulder to grab on to.',
    'I deal with stress in two ways because there are two kinds of stress. There\'s stress that you can take care of and there\'s stress that you can\'t. The first one, I take care of it as fast as possible, because putting it off always makes it worse. Things that I can\'t fix? I think about the fact that I can\'t fix them. I think about why I can\'t fix them and I come to terms with the fact that this is a problem that I\'m not going to overcome and that the world is not a wish granting factory.',

    'I don\'t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.',
    'I don\'t like the sound of all those lists he\'s making - it\'s like taking too many notes at school; you feel you\'ve achieved something when you haven\'t.',
    'I don\'t think about risks much. I just do what I want to do. If you gotta go, you gotta go.',
    'I don\'t think it\'s good that we\'re perceived as different I think it\'s important we\'re perceived as MUCH BETTER. If being different is essential to doing that, then we have to do that, but if we could be much better without being different, that\'d be fine with me. I want to be much better! I don\'t care about being different, but we\'ll have to be different in some ways to be much better.',
    'I don\'t think necessity is the mother of invention - invention, in my opinion, arises directly from idleness, possibly also from laziness. To save oneself trouble.',

    'I don\'t want to sound Pollyannaish, but I hope that out of a tragedy like this something good will come. I hope we understand we\'re one family.',
    'I don\'t want to talk as much. It\'s nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one\'s heart, like treasures. I don\'t like to have them laughed at or wondered over.',
    'I don\'t know what the future of my career holds, but I know that whatever is over the horizon, the road I\'ve traveled to get here is like those Interstates in Texas: everything can look the same, and it can feel like you\'re not going anywhere, until you suddenly get where you\'re going and realize that you\'ve been traveling for a long time.',
    'I don\'t think anyone can DO anything that would make him worthy of love. Love is a gift and cannot be earned. It can only be given.',

    'I finally realized that being grateful to my body was key to giving more love to myself.',

    'I have a problem about being nearly sixty: I keep waking up in the morning and thinking I\'m thirty-one.',
    'I have a right to my anger, and I don\'t want anybody telling me I shouldn\'t be, that it\'s not nice to be, and that something\'s wrong with me because I get angry.',
    'I have a simple philosophy. Fill what\'s empty. Empty what\'s full. And scratch where it itches.',
    'I have always regarded myself as the pillar of my life.',
    'I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts.',
    'I have come to realize that all my trouble with living has come from fear and smallness within me.',
    'I have enjoyed greatly the second blooming that comes when you finish the life of the emotions and of personal relations; and suddenly find - at the age of fifty, say - that a whole new life has opened before you, filled with things you can think about, study, or read about...It is as if a fresh sap of ideas and thoughts was rising in you.',
    'I have failed many times, and that\'s why I am a success.',
    'I have found adventure in flying, in world travel, in business, and even close at hand... Adventure is a state of mind - and spirit.',

    'I have found that it don\'t really matter if you\'re brought up fine or rough, but that it helps to have someone to spill your sorrows to.',
    'I have gotten a lot more attention than...other women that I find incredibly beautiful. And this has happened to me ever since I was a girl, when I was flat, had no teeth, was skinny and small as I could be. I always got more attention than anyone else. If I hadn\'t, I would have made sure I did.',
    'I have learned to love that which is meant to harm me, so that I can stand in the way of those who are less strong. I can take the bullets for those who aren\'t able to.',

    'I have made my world and it is a much better world than I ever saw outside.',
    'I have never been especially impressed by the heroics of people who are convinced they are about to change the world. I am more awed by those who struggle to make one small difference after another.',
    'I have never been hurt by anything I didn\'t say.',
    'I have never thought of writing as hard work, but I have worked hard to find a voice.',
    'I have not yet met with a sorrow that could not be borne, nor with one who\'s passing did not leave me stronger.',
    'I have often wished I had time to cultivate modesty... But I am too busy thinking about myself.',
    'I have seen a peaceful expression turn to anger as fast as a whip cracks, and so the look on the face might mean less than what it seems to be.',
    'I have seen flowers come in stony places',
    'I have the consolation of having added nothing to my private fortune during my public service, and of retiring with hands clean as they are empty.',

    'I know love and lust don\'t always keep the same company.',
    'I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestioned ability of a man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.',
    'I know of only one bird - the parrot - that talks; and it can\'t fly very high.',
    'I know that our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air, and the scenes in which pure air is found. There is not a "fragment" in all nature, for every relative fragment of one thing is a full harmonious unit in itself.',
    'I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.',
    'I like manual labor. Whenever I\'ve got waterlogged with study, I\'ve taken a spell of it and found it spiritually invigorating.',
    'I like the night. Without the dark, we\'d never see the stars.',
    'I like weights. You know where you stand with them. Well, sometimes you\'re lying under them, trying not to let them crush you, but you see, you KNOW they\'d crush you if they could. There\'s honesty.',
    'I live in company with a body, a silent companion, exacting and eternal.',
    'I live now on borrowed time, waiting in the anteroom for the summons that will inevitably come. And then - I go on to the next thing, whatever it is. One doesn\'t luckily have to bother about that.',
    'I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of the tiny pushes of each honest worker.',
    'I look forward to an america in which commands respect throughout the world, not only for its strength, but for its civilization as well. And I look forward to a world in which we will be safe not only for democracy and diversity but also for personal distinction.',
    'I looked always outside of myself to see what I could make the world give me instead of looking within myself to see what was there.',
    'I love life...Yeah, I\'m sad, but at the same time, I\'m really happy that something could make me feel that sad. It\'s like...It makes me feel alive, you know. It makes me feel human. The only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good. So I guess what I\'m feeling is like a beautiful sadness.',
    'I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn\'t pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful\'just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn\'t beautiful.',
    'I love stuff as much as the next guy, but I\'ve come to understand that, regardless of the cost of acquiring it, the price of having it is freedom.',
    'I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions that we didn\'t even know we had and realize that the opposite may also be true.',
    'I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. \'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.',
    'I love you the more that I believe you have liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.',

    'I never dared to be radical when young',
    'I never did give anybody hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell.',
    'I never feel age...If you have creative work, you don\'t have age or time.',
    'I never feel that I have comprehended an emotion, or fully lived even the smallest events, until I have reflected upon it in my journal; my pen is my truest confidant, holding in check the passions and disappointments that I dare not share even with my beloved.',
    'I never lie because I don\'t fear anyone. You only lie when you\'re afraid.',
    'I never saw an ugly thing in my life: for let the form of an object be what it may - light, shade, and perspective will always make it beautiful.',
    'I never trust people\'s assertions, I always judge of them by their actions.',
    'I once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment, while I was hoeing in a village garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that circumstance that I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.',
    'I once read cooking is something you do for your family. But when you\'re alone you sometimes have to treat yourself like family. And now that my apartment\'s redolent with the smell of food it feels more like a home than a box where I hang my hat.',
    'I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite.',
    'I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the Stern Fact, the Sad Self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from.',
    'I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.',
    'I pay no attention whatever to anybody\'s praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings.',
    'I pay very little regard...to what any young person says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.',
    'I ran the wrong kind of business, but I did it with integrity.',
    'I really do believe I can accomplish a great deal with a big grin, I know some people find that disconcerting, but that doesn\'t matter.',
    'I really feel as if the things we create together are not things we devised, but things we discovered, as if, in some sense, they were always there in us, waiting to be revealed, like the figure of Mercury waiting in a rough lump of marble.',
    'I row after health like a waterman...',
    'I said to myself, I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn\'t occurred to me to put them down. I decided to start anew, to strip away what I had been taught.',
    'I say luck is when an opportunity comes along, and you\'re prepared for it.',
    'I see my body as an instrument, rather than an ornament.',
    'I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted.',
    'I shall give life here my best, and I believe it will give its best to me in return.',
    'I shall not pretend that I do not prefer to have people adore me rather than revile me, but I have always found that it was far easier for me to suffer the disapprobation of others than to amend my behaviour in order to find favour with them.',
    'I shut my eyes in order to see.',

    'I tasted too what was called the sweet of revenge - but it was transient, it expired even with the object, that provoked it.',
    'I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music.',
    'I think high self-esteem is overrated. A little low self-esteem is actually quite good\'Maybe you\'re not the best, so you should work a little harder.',
    'I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name.',
    'I think people don\'t place a high enough value on how much they are nurtured by doing whatever it is that totally absorbs them.',
    'I think people that have a brother or sister don\'t realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but to know that there\'s always somebody there, somebody that\'s family.',

    'I think the best evenings are when we have messages, things that make us think, but we can also laugh and enjoy each other\'s company.',
    'I think the first virtue is to restrain the tongue; he approaches nearest to gods who knows how to be silent, even though he is in the right.',
    'I think the promise of fame and what it holds to you as a child and dreaming of it is not what it is. What it is, I\'m not complaining about, but it\'s just different than the reality you dreamed.',
    'I think there\'s a god and I know it\'s not me.',
    'I think we ought always to entertain our opinions with some measure of doubt. I shouldn\'t wish people dogmatically to believe any philosophy, not even mine.',

    'I try to avoid looking backward and keep looking upward.',
    'I used to think of all the billions of people in the world, and of all those people, how was I going to meet the right ones? The right ones to be my friends, the right one to be my husband. Now I just believe you meet the people you\'re supposed to meet.',
    'I value my garden more for being full of blackbirds than of cherries, and very frankly give them fruit for their songs.',
    'I want freedom for the full expression of my personality.',
    'I want to believe in intelligent design, and hence I am suspicious of anything that seems to confirm my desire to believe.',
    'I want to change the pop world one sequin at a time. Artists tend to take themselves way too seriously and don\'t enjoy the fun of making an impact on culture. I just have a good time and sequins represent a good time.',
    'I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.',
    'I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\'s when you know you\'re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.',

    'I was brought up to believe that the only thing worth doing was to add to the sum of accurate information in the world.',
    'I was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow, passing in a blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind.',
    'I was thought to be \'stuck up.\' I wasn\'t. I was just sure of myself. This is and always has been an unforgivable quality to the unsure.',

    'I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness for it shows me the stars.',
    'I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn\'t start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.',
    'I will not allow yesterday\'s success to lull me into today\'s complacency, for this is the great foundation of failure.',

    'I would visualize things coming to me. It would just make me feel better. Visualization works if you work hard. That\'s the thing. You can\'t just visualize and go eat a sandwich.',
    'I write because I\'m afraid to say some things out loud.',
    'I wrote myself a check for ten million dollars for acting services rendered and dated it Thanksgiving 1995. I put it in my wallet and it deteriorated.

    'I\'d heard it all the time, \'Live in the moment.\' But if I did that, I\'d weigh more than a dump truck. Losing weight wasn\'t about the moment at all; it was about having faith in the future. It was about knowing there would be another meal in a few hours.',

    'I\'m not going to quit. Why should I quit? This country is worth fighting for.',

    'I\'ve come to embrace the notion that I haven\'t done enough in my life. I\'ve come to confirm that one\'s title, even a title like president of the United States, says very little about how well one\'s life has been led. No matter how much you\'ve done or how successful you\'ve been, there\'s always more to do, always more to learn, and always more to achieve.',
    'I\'ve decided that the key to happiness is low expectations.',
    'I\'ve learned that all a person has in life is family and friends. If you lose those, you have nothing, so friends are to be treasured more than anything else in the world.',

Was it the way she crossed her legs, the turn of her ankle, the poignant vulnerability of her slender wrists? What are these elusive and ephemeral things that ignite passion in the human heart? That\'s an age-old question. It\'s perfect food for thought on a bright midsummer\'s night.',

    'My Father taught me how to be a man \' and not by instilling in me a sense of machismo or an agenda of dominance. He taught me that a real man doesn\'t take, he gives; he doesn\'t use force, he uses logic; doesn\'t play the role of trouble-maker, but rather, trouble-shooter; and most importantly, a real man is defined by what\'s in his heart, not his pants.',
    'My Father taught me to weigh my words carefully, and speak up only when I had something insightful to add to the proceedings, or something really funny to say. He also taught me that if I couldn\'t be that kind of guy in real life, that I could earn a healthy living pretending to be that guy in the movies \' particularly when paired up with a long haired stoner.',

This can be such a severe blow to their self- esteem that they must eradicate the cause of their distress. Sometimes the only way that parents are able to do that is by returning the child.',
    'One of the joys we have in being human is in exercising our freedom to choose and to take each case as it comes to us. We are not robots who are forced into behaviors by their programming.

    'One should count each day a separate life.',
    'One thing I\'ve learned in all these years is not to make love when you really don\'t feel it; there\'s probably nothing worse you can do to yourself than that.',
    'One thing is clear to me. You can\'t know everything you\'d like to know. You can\'t do everything you\'d like to do. You can\'t read everything you\'d like to read. You must hold onto some things and let go of others. Learning to make that choice is one of the big lessons of this life.',
    'One thing life has taught me: if you are interested, you never have to look for new interests. They come to you. When you are genuinely interested in one thing, it will always lead to something else.',

    'Over the years your bodies become walking autobiographies, telling friends and strangers alike of the minor and major stresses of your lives.',
    'Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories: "We would be more alive if we did more of this," and, "Life would be more lovely if we did less of that." Once we get the pain\'s message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away.',

We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.

    'We made a solemn vow not to take any job outside of show business. We borrowed money from parents and friends, rather than take that lethal job waiting tables. This forced us to take any job offered to us. Anything.

You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names.

    'You can\'t build a reputation on what you are going to do.',
    'You can\'t choose the ways in which you\'ll be tested.',

    'You cannot be mad at somebody who makes you laugh - it\'s as simple as that.',
    'You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one.',
    'You cannot go around and keep score. If you keep score on the good things and the bad things, you\'ll find out that you\'re a very miserable person. God gave man the ability to forget, which is one of the greatest attributes you have.

    'You do ill if you praise, but worse if you censure, what you do not understand.',
    'You do what you have to do to give people closure; it makes them feel better and it doesn\'t cost you much to do it. I\'d rather apologize for something I didn\'t really care about and leave someone on Earth wishing me well.',
    'You do your best work if you do a job that makes you happy.',

    'You have got to discover you, what you do, and trust it.',

They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.',
